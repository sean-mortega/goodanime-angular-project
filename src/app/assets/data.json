          "description": "Both involve a protagonist who is given supernatural powers and creates a masked persona to go by. They both use their newfound powers under their said guises and create a rebel organization dedicated towards fighting the currupt governments and sinister groups respectively. Cid and Lelouch are also very similar in personality. While Cid is also a lot less serious and brooding than Lelouch and tends to act like a fool (both on purpose and accident) but like Lelouch he's got a sadistic side to him. He also implies that he has a master plan that he wants to take himself down to, which Lelouch also shares.\r\n\r\nCode Geass is more story driven with a far more serious tone and theme, along with a more centralized and developed cast. While Eminence feels more like a parody, with many character introductions skimmed or skipped. But there's just enough weight and a ton of self-consciousness to keep it both refreshing and fun to watch. \r\n\r\nCode Geass is definitely the better show, but even in direct comparison Eminence holds up well - and is a solid recommendation for fans of one to go to the other.",

His name starts with Z. However, Zenigata in Lupin III is on the side of law and order, and Dr. Zero on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nIf found these titles quite enjoyable as episodic adventure stories.",

In Birth, it was more the animation, in Kaijuu no Kodomo, more the background art.\r\nIn many scenes, there are people falling or floating.\r\nNot many words are spoken, and if there are, they did not make much sense to me...\r\nThe stories were somehow about birth and rebirth and cosmic forces, but I could not really follow, because during the beautiful scenes, my thoughts were wandering somewhere else and I found myself dozing off, which I consider as a bad sign regarding entertainment value.\r\n\r\nBut for someone who can sit through almost 2 hours just for the beautiful art, I think these films can be recommended.\r\nPeople like me who expect a story may use these films as visual sleeping pills.",
